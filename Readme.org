* Goals
- Be a Navidrome (https://www.navidrome.org/) client
- Be mostly album-centric
- While playing, use as little CPU as possible. 
- Have a very responsive UI
- Correctly render non-English text in the UI
* Non-Goals
- Any kind of music library management
- Extensive integration with external metadata services. Link to something on the web for that. 
- Any kind of UI which requires a redraw while a song is playing
- Support for non-music media
- Support for "internet radio"
* Maybe goals
- Support for other backends. I'm not against this, but I'm not sure I care right now.
- Do the UI in something else. Qt is fine, but it's kind of a lot. I
  dislike gtk. Druid could be nice, but it doesn't currently have font
  character fallback, and can't do virtualized scrolling.
* TODO
- [ ] A UI for choosing your server + authn
- [ ] Put the server password in the system keyring
- [ ] Censor auth tokens from the log output
- [ ] Simple Fade in / Fade out
- [ ] Next button doesn't work (iirc)
- [ ] Desktop integration stuff - notifications, media buttons

* Dev tools
https://github.com/patrickelectric/qhot is the bee's knees. Use it on ui/component_test.qml
